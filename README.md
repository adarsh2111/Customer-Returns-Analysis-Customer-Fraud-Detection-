# Customer-Returns-Analysis-Customer-Fraud-Detection-
>>The project is to understand the returning behavior of a customer. The main motive behind the project was to understand the fraud customer who are returning the SKUs on a false claim. Such customers must be blocked or a particular set of SKUs must be blocked for that customer since they are increasing the returns % which ultimately is not in favor of the organization.
The project can further be divided into two subparts i.e. Returns Analysis and Fraud Detection. I have done works on both the parts the analysis and inferences of which can be found below.
